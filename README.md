# Number guessing game (Python)

This is my first Python Project.

The program generates a randomm number, and the user has to guess it.
The game gives hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

## Concepts used:
- Python basics
- random module
- while loop
- if-else conditions
- user input

## How to Run 
1- Make sure Python is installed
2- Run the file using:
   python game.py
